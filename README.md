# tailTest

## Overview

Establishing comparability of an originator and its biosimilar at the
structural and functional level, by analyzing so-called quality attributes,
is an important step in biosimilar development.
We propose the 'tail-test' to improve the alignment of statistical
hypothesis testing with scientific judgment by shifting away from the
often-used comparison of mean values toward a range-based comparison.
This web-based tool allows to upload a dataset and perform the hypothesis
test or simulate its operating characteristics

The tail-test is described in Mielke J, Innerbichler F, Schiestl M, Ballarini NM, Jones B. The Assessment of Quality Attributes for Biosimilars: a Statistical Perspective on Current Practice and a Proposal. The AAPS journal. 2019 Jan 1;21(1):7.
